### 🧰 **Tool Used:**

**Nessus Essentials** (or specify **OpenVAS** if you used that)

---

### 🖥️ **Scan Target:**

* Localhost (127.0.0.1)
* OR your machine’s IP address (e.g., 192.168.X.X)

---

### 📄 **Summary of Scan Results:**

| Severity Level | Number of Vulnerabilities |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Critical       | e.g., 2                   |
| High           | e.g., 5                   |
